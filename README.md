### Initial Build

Started by talking to my brother about the project idea a little bit. He came up with the name, which I instantly liked.

Bootstrapped with Vercel's AI SDK.

Played around with Chat GPT prompts to see what kind of results I could get - see https://chat.openai.com/share/87bd0bb4-c5dd-46bd-a805-a0c6b47fdbd1

Signed up for the NYTimes API to get content for the prompts.

Set up a serverless edge function to:

1. Get articles from the NYTimes API
2. For each article, send a prompt to gpt-4 `Generate a news article in the style of The Onion set 100 years into the future on this article from today's news. Factor in how drastically different the world would be in 100 years. This news article might not even be relevant: ${article}`
3. Use an OpenAI Function to coerce the model to always return structured JSON as suggested by @jaredpalmer https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1673056725446844417
4. Ask Chat GPT to also generate a prompt for an article image from DALLE 
5. After the image is created, transfer it from the temporary DALLE url to S3.
6. When all the parody articles are generated, stringify the JSON and upload to S3 with the date as the filename.

Next I created a Next.js page that would load the JSON from S3 and render a layout with a grid layout.


### CRON Job

I had the script generation running locally, where it could build a JSON file with all the articles and images. However, this process takes a long time. Vercel has a 10 second limit on their serverless functions. Switching to Edge bumps it up to 30 seconds.

However, if you use the Streams Web API, you can keep the connection open indefinitely. Therefore I decided to switch to the streaming function.
